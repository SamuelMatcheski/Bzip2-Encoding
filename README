## A bzip2-like lossless compression algorithm

Uses Burrows-Wheelers & Move-To-Front Transformations followed by Zero-Runs & Huffman Encoding schemes.

Run `./bzip2 -e` to compress any text file. Will output a compression ratio to stderr (compressed file size relative to original).

Run `./bzip2 -d` to decompress the compressed file.

The compressed output will show as plain text 0's & 1's for readability but can easily be updated to a binary file.

This project is an exercise in complex decoding algorithms.

### Note for creating test cases

On Linux you can create extremely large text files by using:

```bash
tr -dc "A-Za-z 0-9" < /dev/urandom | fold -w100 | head -n 100000 > bigfile.txt
