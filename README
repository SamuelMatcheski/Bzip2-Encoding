## A bzip2-like lossless compression algorithm

Uses Burrows-Wheelers & Move-To-Front Transformations followed by Zero-Runs & Huffman Encoding schemes.

Run ./bzip2 -e to compress any text file. Will output a compression ratio to stderr (compressed file size relative to original)
Run ./bzip2 -d to decompress the compressed file

The compressed output will show as plain text 0's & 1's for readability but can easily be updated to a binary file.
This project is an exercise in complex decoding algorithms. 

### Note for creating test cases

On linux you can create extremely large text files by using:
    > tr -dc "A-Za-z 0-9" < /dev/urandom | fold -w100|head -n 100000 > bigfile.txt
(creates a 100000 line file of 100 char lines)

On Mac you just need to download coreutils, then run using gtr (instead of tr)
